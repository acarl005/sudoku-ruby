# Sudoku 2 Guessing 
 
##Learning Competencies 

* Model a simple real-world procedure in Ruby.
* Use Psuedocode to model 

##Summary 

Starting with your attempt from the [previous iteration of the Sudoku solver](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com//challenges/75), we now want to add the ability to make guessing.

What happens if a square can contain multiple possible numbers and you don't have enough information to conclude right then and there which number it is?

Most people who play Sudoku "guess," usually by writing possibilities in the corners of the square.

##Releases

###Release 0 : Implement a guessing-friendly version of Sudoku

Once we've filled in all cells which have only one possible value, we have to guess.  Write out pseudocode for how that might work before you dive in!

This solver should now be able to solve any Sudoku puzzle, although some will take a long time.  Try it with the `sample.unsolved.txt` file in the source folder.
